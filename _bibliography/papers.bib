  title={The Use of Counterfactuals in Causal Historiography: Insights from Causal Pre-emption and Competing Causes},
  author={Jeong, Tay},
  journal={Forthcomming at Sociological Methods and Research},

  abbr={SMR},

  abstract={Process historiography seeks to identify past events that led up to or brought about a certain outcome of interest. Contrastive historiography seeks to identify past occurrences without which the outcome of interest would not have occurred. Both can be theorized in the language of counterfactuals, but the practical necessity of counterfactual reasoning differs by each type in large part due to complications arising from causal pre-emption. Drawing on a recent version of the Halpern-Pearl account of actual causality, we explain the intimate relationship between the process- and contrastive modes of historiography while accounting for the seeming ease with which historians conduct the former based on knowledge of actual events alone. The theoretical distinction between process- and contrastive historiography has direct methodological implications for the practice of comparative history depending on whether it is sameness- or difference-explaining. We advocate a methodologically moderate approach to counterfactual reasoning in scientific historiography.}

  abstract={We recognise nationalist and centre-seeking ethnic civil wars as distinct types of conflict and draw on key ideas from political sociology to make hypotheses about the causes of each. First, we argue that the character of states shapes antistate actors in ways that channel ethnic conflict in different ways, with pluralist states promoting nationalist warfare but integrative states contributing to centre-seeking civil war. Second, we propose that the relative power of communities affects the type of ethnic civil war, arguing that centre-seeking civil war is most common in situations of communal multipolarity whereas nationalist civil war is concentrated in regions with asymmetric power relations. And because historical statehood promotes elements of pluralist states and asymmetric communal power relations, we hypothesise that the risk of nationalist civil war is high in places with large and longstanding states. To test these hypotheses, we use ethnic fractionalisation to measure configurations of communal power and the state antiquity index to measure level of historical statehood, create a variable measuring the extent to which colonial states were pluralist, and run panel analyses of the odds of civil war onset. With one possible exception, the findings support our hypotheses.}

Doing so considerably disambiguates the latter theory and allows for a more fine-grained comparison with the former. I suggest that the thesis of epistemic advantage be weakened in a way that preserves its insights about the downward rigidity of knowledge while avoiding the unpalatable theoretical, political, and prudential implications that it faces in its present form.}

However, several recent papers radically challenged this hypothesis based on the accumulated literature on stress inoculation and presented cases in which lower-SES adolescents appear to be less vulnerable to suicidal ideation in the face of interpersonal aggression. We re-examine the link between psychological vulnerability to acute stressors and SES using yearly longitudinal public survey data from South Korea.We reaffirm the well-established finding that bullying victimhood strongly and consistently increases the odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 1.859, p < 0.01). However, we find no evidence in favor of the traditional “differential vulnerability hypothesis” or the recently proposed counterhypothesis.}

An analysis of newly collected group-level data on communal legislative representation shows that having been in a colony that had this institution greatly increased the risk of ethnic warfare, but whether an ethnic group was or was not a beneficiary of this policy within such a colony provides no information. I also test how colonial communal representation combines with postcolonial exclusion to predict ethnic warfare. I interpret the results with insights from strain theory.}

However, the burgeoning psychological literature on stress inoculation shows that too little exposure to adversity may also compromise resilience. An analysis of a large cross-sectional sample of Korean adolescents reveals that, consistent with the “inverted-U” theory, resilience to suicidal ideation is highest for those who report medium levels of chronic stress and who self-identify as having a medium level of family economic status.}

We confirm our statistical findings through a historical case study of the Karens in Myanmar, paying attention to the historical significance of each type of CCP that we examine in the statistical analysis.}

After June 2018, which corresponds to the third period, all negotiating parties standardly used the term ‘security guarantee,’ with ‘the DPRK’ as its intended recipient. But how did South Korean media report on this term? Based on the observation that most reports arbitrarily quoted the term as “regime security guarantee,” we analyzed news articles from 24 major South Korean newspapers and news broadcasts. We also compare the citation accuracy of South Korean media to those of English, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian-language media and show that South Korean media are by far the least accurate.}

The historical trajectory of other notable indicators of biological living standards such as consumption, wage, and inequality also supports this conclusion.}
