  abstract={Process historiography seeks to identify past events that led up to or brought about a certain outcome of interest. Contrastive historiography seeks to identify past occurrences without which the outcome of interest would not have occurred. Both can be theorized in the language of counterfactuals, but the practical necessity of counterfactual reasoning differs by each type in large part due to complications arising from causal pre-emption. Drawing on a recent version of the Halpern-Pearl account of actual causality, we explain the intimate relationship between the process- and contrastive modes of historiography while accounting for the seeming ease with which historians conduct the former based on knowledge of actual events alone. The theoretical distinction between process- and contrastive historiography has direct methodological implications for the practice of comparative history depending on whether it is sameness- or difference-explaining. We advocate a methodologically moderate approach to counterfactual reasoning in scientific historiography.}
