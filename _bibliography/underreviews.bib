  abstract={Process historiography seeks to identify past events that led up to or brought about a certain outcome of interest. Contrastive historiography seeks to identify past occurrences without which the outcome of interest would not have occurred. Both can be theorized in the language of counterfactuals, but the practical necessity of counterfactual reasoning differs by each type in large part due to complications arising from causal pre-emption. Drawing on a recent version of the Halpern-Pearl account of actual causality, we explain the intimate relationship between the process- and contrastive modes of historiography while accounting for the seeming ease with which historians conduct the former based on knowledge of actual events alone. The theoretical distinction between process- and contrastive historiography has direct methodological implications for the practice of comparative history depending on whether it is sameness- or difference-explaining. We advocate a methodologically moderate approach to counterfactual reasoning in scientific historiography.}

  title={Hamas or Palestine? The Discursive Battle over the 2023 Israel-Hamas War and the Global Distribution of Partisan Search Interest - preprint},
  author={Jeong, Tay and Jeong, Choong Kyo},

  abstract={This study charts the discursive conflict over the 2023 Israel-Hamas War and estimate the global distribution partisan discourse in the initial month of the War. With the help of international X (Twitter) trends data, we identify two ideal types of pro-Palestine discourses, namely, a “humanitarian” kind focusing on “Palestine-the-victim” popular in a large portion of the world including the West and a “radical” kind broadly supported in the Muslim World characterized by an attention to “Palestine-the-hero”. Pro-Israel hashtag activism, on the other hand, paid overwhelming attention to Hamas with moral blame as the dominant emotive theme. Building on the finding that the topical foci between Palestine/Gaza and Hamas robustly discriminate pro-Israel and pro-Palestine discursive frames, we examine the ratio of Google search volumes between these topics throughout the world, which, unsurprisingly, strongly align with available cross-national opinion polls on the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. Overall interest in the War, the proportion of Muslims, and anti-American sentiment significantly predicted a pro-Palestine skew in online search interest.}
