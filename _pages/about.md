Curiosity about the world and knowledge

My first journey, driven by curiosity about the world, was learning languages. Before entering college, I learned several foreign languages, including English, German, French, and Japanese, by imagining the scenery and people's lives of strange countries at home. After college, my long-term “living” away from home in Hong Kong, Zurich, Fukuoka, London, and Montreal was my second journey driven by curiosity about the world.

Intellectual exploration was my journey in another dimension. I studied economics and finance, development studies, history, philosophy, and sociology in many places around the world. It is only after you have studied a lot in a field that you finally understand what it is.
In my long journey in the world and knowledge, I had to overcome many difficulties. Even now, research is still difficult, but there is so much research I want to do. These days, after completing my doctoral program, I am enjoying intellectual adventures to the fullest in my personal laboratory.

I welcome feedback or comments on my published papers. All my first-authored publications already contain full replication material (in case data-sharing is prohibited, I provide instructions on how to obtain them).
