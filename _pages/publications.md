My primary domain of interest is international or interethnic conflict. My work on conflict includes both armed conflict and cognitive-affective conflict. My past academic research in this field was often historical, but my ongoing projects and professional services also deal with current affairs.  

I have another major research program in the social determinants of mental health. I am particularly interested in the concept of resilience and how various social and developmental factors influence psychological resilience to acute stressors.  

Last but not least, I should also mention my burgeoning contributions in social epistemology, which relates to my training on the sociology of knowledge but makes a more conceptual turn. I especially like to think about the epistemic implications of diversity in its sociodemographic and ideational dimensions.  

Due to my multidisciplinary educational background, I am trained in and have used three broad types of research methods: Quantitative, historical, and philosophical. I have taken research methods very seriously throughout my graduate studies, resulting in past or ongoing methodological contributions to quantitative methods (in the domain of multilevel modeling and causal inference) and historical methods (counterfactual reasoning in history and comparative history).  

I welcome feedback or comments on my published papers. All my first-authored publications already contain full replication material (in case data-sharing is prohibited, I provide instructions on how to obtain them).
