My primary domain of interest is international or interethnic conflict. My work on conflict includes both armed conflict and discursive conflict. My past academic research in this field was often historical, but my ongoing projects and professional services also deal with current affairs.  

Relatedly, I like to study why different groups of people reason and feel differently and the resulting normative problems in epistemology and ethics.   

Last but not least, I have a fruitful secondary interest in the social determinants of mental health. I am particularly interested in the concept of resilience and how various social and developmental factors influence psychological resilience to acute stressors. 

Due to my multidisciplinary educational background, I am trained in and have used three broad types of research methods: Quantitative, historical, and philosophical. I have taken research methods very seriously throughout my graduate studies, resulting in methodological contributions to quantitative methods (in the domain of multilevel modeling and causal inference) and historical methods (counterfactual reasoning in history and comparative history).
